    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm Madeline. I created this website to encourage conversations around 
        <strong>impact-driven engineering.</strong> Rather than serving as another portfolio of
        personal projects that lack real application, my goal is to provide genuine assets. I believe that every project 
        should be purposeful and designed to deliver tangible value to the user. That commitment is my guarantee to
        you as you browse my content.
        </p>
<p>
        As for my personal credentials, I hold both a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Computer Science from NC State University.
        My academic work centered on software security and system defenses, while my professional experience in financial services has
        focused on cybersecurity compliance, specifically in regulatory event analysis and reporting. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My background spans programming in various languages (particularly lower-level languages),
         developing secure software practices, and applying frameworks to secure the entire product lifecycle and its supply chain. 
         My work has focused on regulatory intelligence, where I align and standardize compliance processes to
         meet a wide range of legal requirements. This eliminates the need for reactive analysis, allowing the organization to be 
         prepared for regulatory obligations across all applicable jurisdictions. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond academics and professional work, I enjoy bridging disciplines and challenging the notion that technical
        concepts must remain siloed or inaccessible. I have always aimed to differentiate myself from being "just a programmer" by 
        focusing on making complex, often "gatekept," topics clear and understandable. This perspective drives my <em>Thought Matter</em>
        writings and my belief that cross-disciplinary collaboration is essential for advancing both security and organizational strategy.
        Great engineers are not only defined by their technical skills, but by their ability to connect technology 
        with clear business priorities. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, welcome to my website. This is a place where I honor and value contributions from all roles, because security thrives when every perspective is included.
    </p>
