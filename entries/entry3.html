<h2>You’re Speaking to Your General Counsel Wrong</h2>

If you have read a single book on leadership, you’d know that real leadership is about the influence that comes from communicating, motivating, and building trust. 
People respond best when they feel their actions are meaningful, appreciated, and aligned with their own personal or career goals. 
Instead of criticizing what they’re doing wrong, highlight what they are doing well, set small achievable goals, and frame requests in a way that lets them see the positive impact of their involvement. 
This principle is especially important when working with your internal General Counsel (GC). 
By approaching them in a way that makes them feel they are protecting the company effectively and exercising their expertise without sharp, emotional judgment, you create a sense of purpose. 
In other words, you’re both asking legal for their review and input while helping them do something that reflects their skills, judgment, and value. 
Yet, surprisingly, many professionals still don’t know how to talk to legal to get mutually satisfying outcomes. 
If legal feels they need to soften or withhold advice to avoid being dismissed, overlooked, or cast as “the bad guy,” they may hold back on outlining all potential risks. 
Remember, their job is to present the harsh realities, not to critique your ideas or make you feel bad. 
You actually <i>want</i> them to come to you with the full set of thoughts and details they considered while reviewing their work. If they approach you openly and with all that information, it’s a sign that both of you are doing things right. 
Many people assume legal would be easier to work with if they provided fewer details, so the process wouldn’t feel slowed down.
However, that would end up being a complete disaster. If your GC just says ‘nice work’ and nothing else, or doesn’t leave you with pages of notes, comments, and highlighted text, then that’s a big red flag. 
It usually means they aren’t fully engaging with your work, and important risks or considerations might not be coming up. 
Hearing only praise with no substance often signals that the review isn’t thorough. 
So the next time you end a long meeting with your GC, instead of being frustrated by a flood of comments, recognize it as a sign that they’re doing their job thoroughly and helping you catch important risks as a trusted partner.
</p>

  Here is the hard truth: your General Counsel operates in a unique, independent role within the company. 
  Even though they’re employees, their job is to provide unbiased legal advice, not to be a “yes person” or to approve your business decisions quickly. 
  This independence is how the legal function <i>must</i> work to protect the company from risks you might not immediately see, yet some still believe GC acts with a level of obstruction or bureaucracy. 
  
</p>
<br>
<p>
    A common misconception is that a GC even “approves” decisions at all. 
    In reality, a GC reviews, advises, and clears legal aspects rather than formally approving them in the way a manager might sign off on a project. 
    They rarely make business decisions themselves; their input is advisory and risk-focused, while final decisions usually happen at an executive or project-owner level. 
    Even when a GC “signs off,” it is often contingent on certain conditions, risk acknowledgements, or mitigations being in place. It’s more accurate to think of your GC as a partner in managing legal risk and one that provides guidance upon review of material that is presented to them.

</p>

Many people get frustrated when “speaking to legal.” They refer to it as “dealing with legal” rather than working with legal.
They bring emotion, impatience, or frustration to each conversation or meeting. 
They might also think, <i>Why can’t they just give me clear answers? Why do I have to tiptoe around them? Why can’t they learn to communicate more clearly?</i>
While these are natural (and normally the most common) reactions, they miss the point entirely. 
To be effective, you — not legal — need to shift your mindset and approach. 
Instead of going into meetings demanding answers, you have to go in respecting their role and expertise while listening to their concerns, understanding the constraints they operate under, and asking the risk questions in the right way. 
</p>

<p>

    Getting good at this communication style is a leadership skill that goes beyond just working with legal, as it applies to any independent function or stakeholder that doesn’t report directly to you but influences your business outcomes. 

</p>

<br>

<p>Now, once you accept that you need to adjust your mindset, here are a few key strategies I have found effective to communicate with them in a way that improves collaboration:</p>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Come Prepared, But Stay Open:</strong> Legal advice often depends on details. When you approach your GC, bring all relevant facts upfront (as they will have many documents themselves). Explain exactly what decisions you’re trying to enable, but don’t come with a fixed expectation of “yes” or “no.” Instead, come ready to explore multiple alternatives or possibilities. Think of it as a growing decision tree (though this is easy for me to say with an engineering background). But unlike a clean algorithm, the legal “tree” isn’t always linear. Branches will often loop back, there will be many “dead-ends” that influence future paths, and sometimes the most efficient route isn’t even clear until other actors in the scenario like regulators or counterparties make their moves. A good GC will help you prune the tree into realistic options and point out which paths carry hidden risks. They will also suggest grafts from other branches like different regulatory frameworks. Your role is to frame the decision space clearly, while being open to how the lawyer may redraw parts of it entirely.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Ask Specific Questions, But Be OK If Their Answer Isn’t Clear:</strong> Focused, specific questions are great to start with, however, you must also be prepared for answers that are sometimes vague or even unclear. Legal’s role requires them to consider many possible risks, causing their advice to come with conditions or require further analysis that sets up future meetings. Instead of pushing for all your questions to be answered, learn to be comfortable with this ambiguity. It’s part of their job to protect the company from unpredictable legal exposure. Use this as an opportunity to ask what factors contribute to this uncertainty, what additional information they need, or what scenarios you should plan for. This way, you won’t feel like you are stuck at a dead end and you are able to continue the conversation constructively.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Respect Their Role:</strong> Regardless of how many people believe that GC is an indecisive gatekeeper that shuffles around things and avoids accountability, the reality is that at the simplest description, they are risk managers and protectors just like compliance and audit. When you approach legal with that understanding, the dynamic changes completely. Use language that acknowledges their position and shows you’re partners. For example, try the following:
        <ul>
            <li>“Where do you see the biggest risks, and what can we do proactively to mitigate them?”</li>
            <li>“What is your advice on balancing the risk here with our business priorities?”</li>
            <li>“Are there local laws or regulations we might be overlooking as we enter this market?”</li>
            <li>“What potential risks do you see in sharing data or IP with this partner, and how can we mitigate them?”</li>
            <li>“How can we structure this agreement to limit our liability but still keep the deal attractive to the other party?”</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Manage Your Emotions:</strong> It’s easy to get frustrated if legal advice feels too obscure to follow, unlike clear directions on what to do next. But reacting emotionally often shuts down communication. If you disagree with their view, ask for clarification and the reasoning behind it. Avoid language that might unintentionally sound confrontational and demanding, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>“Why do you always say no to each idea?”</li>
            <li>“Just give me a straight answer.”</li>
            <li>“Can’t you make this easier for us?”</li>
        </ul>
        One of the most powerful approaches is to acknowledge their perspective upfront before even presenting your ideas at all. Here’s one example of how it can be used: <i>“I know you have to consider a lot of risks I might not see, so I want to get your take on…”</i>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Provide Context and Business Impact:</strong> Legal teams don’t always know the full business context. Explain the commercial implications clearly. Use GC to see around corners, as they often have visibility into risks that business leaders can’t anticipate (IP, foreign law, additional reputational fallout). Translate the business needs into risk-oriented questions. Lawyers don’t think in “revenue growth” or “user engagement,” rather, in exposure and obligations. Flag any deadlines upfront instead of treating GC review as something you’ve been holding off.
    </li>
</ol>


<p>When you start thinking from their perspective, you immediately gain a competitive advantage in business acumen. You’ll realize that legal advice often comes with caution because their entire job is to anticipate risk and protect the company, not prevent anyone from ever making a decision. You are, essentially, working with a few common goals in mind. No one wants regulatory penalties, contract disputes, or reputational damage as a result of a decision they made. 
</p>
<br>

<p>
Also remember, you can find a balance between speed and compliance. If legal hesitates to provide a definitive answer or their response feels too vague, don’t let frustration or emotion stall your entire process. Recognize that ambiguity is often inherent in legal advice because of the many variables involved. It’s perfectly acceptable (depending on the severity and context) to move forward while marking an issue as an area of uncertainty or potential risk so long as you document it clearly and continue monitoring as things evolve. Understanding this balance sets apart effective leaders from reactive managers.
</p>

<br>
<p>
In the end, speaking effectively to your General Counsel is not about “getting legal to say yes/no” and more about building a partnership on mutual respect. You end up establishing a solid balance of business objectives with legal risks, allowing you to make more informed, more confident decisions. Remember, legal was never there to make those decisions for you; that’s not their job, nor should anyone expect it to be. 
Their role is to advise and protect, while <strong>you</strong> lead and decide.
