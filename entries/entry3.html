Most books on leadership emphasize the power of influence, motivation and trust. We know people perform their best when they feel their work is meaningful and aligned with their personal goals and core expertise. This principle is especially important when working with internal General Counsel (GC). By approaching your GC in a way that acknowledges their expertise and validates their essential role as the company’s advisement function, you empower them to do their job thoroughly. You are asking for their legal input while appreciating their skills and judgment. Yet, surprisingly, many professionals don’t know how to talk to legal to obtain mutually satisfying outcomes. When a GC operates in an environment where their detailed feedback is consistently met with impatience, resistance, or dismissal, the dynamic itself encourages professional self-censorship. The pressure to avoid being cast as “the bad guy” can lead a GC to soften their advice. This is a complete disaster. You want your legal counsel to deliver the fullest, most detailed analysis possible, even if it’s unpleasant. Their job is to present the harsh realities and potential risks, not to criticize business ideation. If your GC just says ‘nice work’ and leaves you with minimal notes, that’s a sign of gravitation toward the path of least resistance. This common, yet damaging, dynamic pushes legal to deliver only the minimum viable advice to avoid being cast as the company bottleneck. The legal function needs to be fully engaging, and a flood of comments is a sign of a trusted partner doing a thorough job. 
</p>

<p>
Here is the hard truth: your General Counsel operates in a unique, independent role within the company. Even though they’re employees, their job is to provide unbiased legal advice, not to be a “yes person” or to approve your business decisions quickly. This independence is how the legal function must work to protect the company from risks you might not immediately see, yet some still believe GC acts with a level of obstruction or bureaucracy.

A common misconception is that a GC even “approves” decisions at all. In reality, a GC reviews, advises, and clears legal aspects rather than formally approving them in the way a manager might sign off on a project. They rarely make business decisions themselves; their input is advisory and risk-focused, while final decisions usually happen at an executive or project-owner level. As Richard Ostrander, General Counsel for the New York Federal Reserve, noted, <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2024/ost240419">“The Legal function is identifying risks, but is not making a decision about whether the institution should accept them.”</a> This separation is critical: the attorney-client relationship can become legally complicated, and the GC’s duty to protect the corporation can be blurred when legal professionals become business decision-makers, a concern reinforced by professional conduct rules like the ABA Model Rule (specifically <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_13_organization_as_client/">Rule 1.13: Organization as Client)</a>. Even when a GC “signs off,” it is often contingent on certain conditions, risk acknowledgements, or mitigations being in place. It’s more accurate to think of your GC as a partner in managing legal risk and one that provides guidance upon review of material that is presented to them.

Many people get frustrated when “speaking to legal.” They refer to it as “dealing with legal” rather than working with legal. They bring emotion, impatience, or frustration to each conversation or meeting. 
They might also think, <i>Why can’t they just give me clear answers? Why do I have to tiptoe around them? Why can’t they learn to communicate more clearly?</i> While these are natural (and normally the most common) reactions, they miss the point entirely. 
To be effective, <i>you</i> — not legal — need to shift your mindset and approach. Instead of going into meetings demanding answers, you have to go in respecting their role and expertise while listening to their concerns, understanding the constraints they operate under, and asking the risk questions in the right way. 
</p>
<br>
<p>

Getting good at this communication style is a leadership skill that goes beyond just working with legal, as it applies to any independent function or stakeholder that doesn’t report directly to you but influences your business outcomes. 

</p>

<br>

<p>Now, once you accept that you need to adjust your mindset, here are a few key strategies I have found effective to communicate with them in a way that improves collaboration:</p>
<br>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Come Prepared, But Stay Open:</strong> Legal advice often depends on details. When you approach your GC, bring all relevant facts upfront. Explain exactly what decisions you’re trying to enable, but don’t come with a fixed expectation of “yes” or “no.” Instead, come ready to explore multiple alternatives or possibilities. Think of it as a growing decision tree (though this is easy for me to say with an engineering background). But unlike a clean algorithm, the legal “tree” isn’t always linear. Branches will often loop back, there will be many “dead-ends” that influence future paths, and sometimes the most efficient route isn’t even clear until other actors in the scenario like regulators or counterparties make their moves. A good GC will help you prune the tree into realistic options and point out which paths carry hidden risks. They will also suggest grafts from other branches like different regulatory frameworks. Your role is to frame the decision space clearly, while being open to how the lawyer may redraw parts of it entirely.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Ask Specific Questions, But Be OK If Their Answer Isn’t Clear:</strong> Focused, specific questions are great to start with, however, you must also be prepared for answers that are sometimes vague or even unclear. Legal’s role requires them to consider many possible risks, causing their advice to come with conditions or require further analysis that sets up future meetings. Instead of pushing for all your questions to be answered, learn to be comfortable with this ambiguity. It’s part of their job to protect the company from unpredictable legal exposure. Use this as an opportunity to ask what factors contribute to this uncertainty, what additional information they need, or what scenarios you should plan for. This way, you won’t feel like you are stuck at a dead end and you are able to continue the conversation constructively.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Respect Their Role:</strong> Regardless of how many people believe that GC is an indecisive gatekeeper that shuffles around things and avoids accountability, the reality is that at the simplest description, they are risk managers and protectors just like compliance and audit. When you approach legal with that understanding, the dynamic changes completely. To acknowledge their position and reinforce a partnership, try leading your conversations with language like this:
        <ul>
            <li>“Where do you see the biggest risks, and what specific mitigation steps should we prioritize now?”</li>
            <li>"This strategy involves an elevated level of [type of risk]. What is your advice on balancing the specific exposure with our stated business priorities for growth?”</li>
            <li>“Are there local laws or regulations we might be overlooking as we enter this market?”</li>
            <li>Instead of asking if a contract is “okay”: “What potential risks do you see in sharing data or IP with this partner, and how can we structure the agreement to limit our liability while still keeping the deal attractive to the other party?”</li>
            <li>“As we scope out [new product or initiative], are there local laws or regulations we might be overlooking that could fundamentally change our [product or service] design or distribution model?”</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Manage Your Emotions:</strong> It’s easy to get frustrated if legal advice feels too obscure to follow, unlike the clear, sequential directions you might get from an engineering team. But reacting emotionally often shuts down the very dialogue you need. If you disagree with their interpretation, your goal should not to argue or coerce, but to understand the underlying legal constraints. Avoid these common, counterproductive phrases that trigger defensiveness:
        <ul>
            <li>“Why do you always say no to each idea?”</li>
            <li>“Just give me a straight answer.”</li>
            <li>“Can’t you make this easier for us?”</li>
        </ul>
        Instead, master the art of framing. One of the most powerful moves you can make is to acknowledge their perspective and core function upfront before presenting your idea(s). This instantly validates their role without confrontation or permission. Try leading with an acknowledgement, like this: <i>“I know you have to consider a lot of risks I might not be seeing from the business side, so I want to get your take on…”</i>

    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Provide Context and Business Impact:</strong> Legal teams don’t always know the full business context. Explain the commercial implications clearly. Use GC to see around corners, as they often have visibility into risks that business leaders can’t anticipate (IP, foreign law, additional reputational fallout). Translate the business needs into risk-oriented questions. Lawyers don’t think in “revenue growth” or “user engagement,” rather, in exposure and obligations. Flag any deadlines upfront instead of treating GC review as something you’ve been holding off.
    </li>
</ol>


<p>When you start thinking from their perspective, you immediately gain a competitive advantage in business acumen. You’ll realize that legal advice often comes with caution because their entire job is to anticipate risk and protect the company, not prevent anyone from ever making a decision. You are, essentially, working with a few common goals in mind. No one wants regulatory penalties, contract disputes, or reputational damage as a result of a decision they made. 
</p>
<br>

<p>
Also remember, you can find a balance between speed and compliance. If legal hesitates to provide a definitive answer or their response feels too vague, don’t let frustration or emotion stall your entire process. Recognize that ambiguity is often inherent in legal advice because of the many variables involved. It’s perfectly acceptable (depending on the severity and context) to move forward while marking an issue as an area of uncertainty or potential risk so long as you document it clearly and continue monitoring as things evolve. Understanding this balance sets apart effective leaders from reactive managers.
</p>

<br>
<p>
In the end, speaking effectively to your General Counsel is not about “getting legal to say yes/no” and more about building a partnership on mutual respect. You end up establishing a solid balance of business objectives with legal risks, allowing you to make more informed, more confident decisions. Remember, legal was never there to make those decisions for you; that’s not their job, nor should anyone expect it to be. 
Their role is to advise and protect, while <strong>you</strong> lead and decide.
